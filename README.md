# Fast Food Chains Nutrition Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is centered around analyzing nutritional data from various fast food chains. The primary goal is to gain insights into the nutritional values of different fast food items, possibly comparing across different chains.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
The following libraries are required to run the project:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- plotly
- seaborn
- requests
- BeautifulSoup
- tqdm

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone [repository-link]
```

### Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the `DSCI 511 Final Project.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.
3. Run the cells sequentially to see the analysis and results.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset that contains nutritional information of items from various fast food chains. This may include data like calories, fat content, sugar, and other nutritional metrics.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The notebook includes preprocessing of the raw data to make it suitable for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducting statistical analysis and extracting meaningful patterns from the data.
- **Visualization**: Creating graphs and plots to visualize the data and analysis results.

## Sections in the Notebook
- **Importing Required Libraries**: This section includes the import statements of all the necessary Python libraries.
- **McDonalds**: Analysis specific to McDonald's menu items. (Additional sections may be included for other fast food chains.)

## Results
The notebook aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the nutritional content of fast food items. The results section will detail key findings and insights drawn from the data.
